# Building RedSea for macOS from Windows

Since you can't build native macOS apps from Windows, here are your options:

## Option 1: GitHub Actions (FREE & Automated) ⭐

**Best option - completely automated builds**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. The workflow file I created (`.github/workflows/build-mac.yml`) will automatically:
   - Build on macOS runners
   - Create a `.app` bundle
   - Create a DMG installer
   - Upload as release artifacts

**To trigger:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags
```

This creates professional macOS releases automatically!

## Option 2: Cloud Mac Services

Rent a Mac in the cloud for building:

### MacInCloud ($20-30/month)
- Rent a real Mac remotely
- Build native macOS apps
- Cancel after building

### AWS EC2 Mac Instances
- More expensive but powerful
- Good for professional development

### Paperspace Mac
- Virtual Mac desktop
- Good for occasional building

## Option 3: One-Line Installer (Python Source)

Instead of .app bundles, distribute Python source with easy installation:

**Users run:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://your-site.com/install-mac.sh | bash
```

This automatically installs everything they need.

## Option 4: Local Mac Access

If you know someone with a Mac:
1. Give them the build files
2. They run `python3 build_mac.py`
3. They send you back the `.app` file

## Recommendation

**Start with GitHub Actions** - it's free, automatic, and creates professional releases. Just push your code to GitHub and tag a release!

The workflow I created will:
- ✅ Build on real macOS hardware
- ✅ Include all dependencies
- ✅ Create installer DMG
- ✅ Attach to GitHub releases
- ✅ Work forever without maintenance

No Mac required on your end!
